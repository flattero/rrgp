        <h1>The Rangi Graduate</h1>
        <h2>Read the card that is displayed here.</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Identify the trait/disposition. What terms can we identify?</li>
          <li>How do we define these terms? What do they mean?</li>
          <li>What examples can you recall from your time at Rangi that have allowed you to grow in this area?</li>
          <li>If you could give yourself a score out of 10 for this skill/disposition, what would it be and why?</li>
          <li>Has there been a time where you have helped someone else grow in this area?</li>
          <li>Why is this skill/disposition included? Why do we value it?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Action - Choose One</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>What opportunities are there for us as a school to better help students build in this skill. Do you have an idea or can you design something (a product, service or event) to acheive this? Doing this would require empathy, creativity, innovation and courage, because you might fail (but that's ok!).</li>
          <li>Set yourself a smart goal, something small that you will be able to acheive in the next week, that relates directly to your growth in this skill, or in helping someone else grow.</li>
